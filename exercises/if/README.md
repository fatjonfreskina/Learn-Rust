# If

`if`, the most basic (but still surprisingly versatile!) type of control flow, is what you'll learn here.

## Further information

- [Control Flow - if expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#if-expressions)

## Notes

- You can do something like:
```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```
- condition must be a boolean
- variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the number variable is

## Loops

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```
Returning Values from Loops
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```
##Â For 

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```
Or
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```

## Range loop reversed

```rust
fn main() {
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
} // 3! 2! 1!
```
