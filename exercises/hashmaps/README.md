# Hashmaps
A *hash map* allows you to associate a value with a particular key.
You may also know this by the names [*unordered map* in C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map), 
[*dictionary* in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) or an *associative array* in other languages.

This is the other data structure that we've been talking about before, when
talking about Vecs.

### Using Hashmaps

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);
```

Here, score will have the value that’s associated with the Blue team, and the result will be 10. The get method returns an Option<&V>; if there’s no value for that key in the hash map, get will return None. This program handles the Option by calling copied to get an Option<i32> rather than an Option<&i32>, then unwrap_or to set score to zero if scores doesn't have an entry for the key.

### Iteration

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

for (key, value) in &scores {
    println!("{}: {}", key, value);
    }
```

### Hash Maps and Ownership

For types that implement the Copy trait, like i32, the values are copied into the hash map. For owned values like String, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
// see what compiler error you get!
```

### Updating a Hash Map

Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key can only have one value associated with it at a time. 

When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could keep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the key doesn’t already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the new value

### Overwriting the value in Hashmap

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores); // {"Blue": 25}
```

### Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn’t Present

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores); // {"Blue": 10, "Yellow": 50}
```

### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map); // {"hello": 1, "world": 2, "wonderful": 1}
```

Recall from the “Accessing Values in a Hash Map” section that iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary order.
